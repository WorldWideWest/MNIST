# MNIST

This project is a simple implementation of a Pytorch machine learning algorithm that classifies hand written numbers from 0 to 9.

The algorithm is based in the `model.py` file, and the implementation is in the jupyter notebook.

The implementation is written in Python with the [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) framework. The dataset is also downloaded from Torchvision.

The implemented neural network is the CNN (Convolutional Neural Network).
